## Introduction
Hi and welcome!

This is a test project I put together. The aim of this application is to practise component building in React and play around with different tools. Its purpose is therefore not meant for production.

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to let the user run a search term and based on which, an api call to youtube will be fired. The api call will return videos based on the search term.

The application is meant for public use, even though it's not hosted anywhere as such.

## Setup
The API key is left blank, so it can be re-used for learning purposes.

The app is created with create-react-app boilerplate. It is based on components that connect to each other. It consists of parent and child components, which is similar to atomic design in the structure.
